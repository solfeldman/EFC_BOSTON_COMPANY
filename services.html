Do not hesitate </span><a href="contact.html"><span class="text-span-7">contacting us</span></a><span class="text-span-5"> to review whatever you have on your mind, whether it is an already developed detailed floor plan, an idea for your dream house, or just a thought you have had about improving your existing house.<br>‍<br>We are great at listening. In fact, we enjoy the planning aspect of our business, as much as we enjoy implementing our plans. I can assure you that we are very good at it. Many of our clients say that we are the best. Here are several testimonials from our happy customers.</span><br><br><br><br><em>“For many years, I lived in a condo near Brookline High School. The idea of fixing my kitchen did cross my mind myriad times. Although, what Irina proposed was so far beyond any of my dreams. We actually built a house addition with huge windows, leading to an outside porch. The whole new addition is the beautiful kitchen. When I look at it, I still do not believe that it is real.”</em><br><br><span class="text-span-4">~ Lilia Muchnik</span><br><br><br><em>“The reason we bought the house from Irina because my mother loved it. She lives in another country and has never seen the house, but she loved the pictures of it that I sent her. This is not a house, she said, this is a piece of art. For the past three years, me, my husband and our three children, enjoy the most beautiful and most practical house we ever lived in. The location at Washington square could not be more convenient. I keep telling to my husband, my mother is always right.”</em><br><br><span class="text-span-3">~ Sarina Elmariah</span><br><br><br><em>“Dealing with a local historical society could be quite involved. People there have a sense of entitlement. Since they usually live in town for a long time and are naturally trying to preserve the status quo. This goes against the grain of any developer who is trying to enhance the town, its houses and amenities. Alex was that perfect developer with a know-how to strike a balance of ... dealing with preservation society and also completing renovation of my house ahead of schedule.”</em><br><br><span class="text-span-2">~ Victoria Matiouchina</span><strong><br></strong></div>
